# Parametric settings of functional projections in diachrony (corpus study)

Paper that Giuseppe Samo and I are working on as part of my SNSF-funded 'Focus in diachrony' research project at the University of Cambridge, UK.

The handout for our preliminary presentation of the project at the University of Oxford was created using a template from [OverLeaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-submissions-to-scientific-reports/xyrztqvdccns).
