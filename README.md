# Parametric settings of functional projections in diachrony (corpus study)

Paper that Giuseppe Samo and I are working on as part of my SNSF-funded 'Focus in diachrony' research project at the University of Cambridge, UK.

The handout for our preliminary presentation of the project at the University of Oxford was created using a template from [OverLeaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-submissions-to-scientific-reports/xyrztqvdccns).

The data from ESLO 1-2 were extracted and classified for a joint paper written by myself and Lena Baunaz, and then analysed by myself for the Oxford presentation. These include data from the 1970s and then 2014.

The diachronic data were scraped by myself (see `scraper` directory), and then classified and analysed with Giuseppe Samo for the Oxford presentation. These include text from about 500 French theatre plays written between 1500 and 1900.

A possible further development might include the analysis of the data from 88mil SMS (see `data` folder).
